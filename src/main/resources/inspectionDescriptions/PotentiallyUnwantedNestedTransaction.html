    Detects methods annotated with <code>@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)</code> that are called within an existing transaction,
    which may lead to unwanted nested transactions and performance issues.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection identifies cases where a method marked with <code>Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW</code> is executed inside another transaction.
    Since this creates a separate transaction instead of participating in the existing one, it can cause unexpected behavior,
    resource locking, or unnecessary overhead.
</p>
<p>
    Example:
</p>
<pre><code>
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    void saveAuditLog() {
        // Saves audit log in a new transaction
    }

    @Transactional
    void process() {
        saveAuditLog(); // This starts a new transaction while one is already active
    }
</code></pre>
