    Detects methods annotated with <code>@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)</code> that are called within an active transaction,
    which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection checks whether a method marked with <code>Propagation.NEVER</code> is executed while a transaction is active.
    If a transaction is already running when the method is called, the inspection highlights the annotation and suggests
    removing the transaction from the calling context.
</p>
<p>
    Example:
</p>
<pre><code>
    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NEVER)
    void logOperation() {
        // Logging operation that must not be in a transaction
    }

    @Transactional
    void process() {
        logOperation(); // This will cause an error because a transaction is active
    }
</code></pre>
